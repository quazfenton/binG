The service can detect advanced use cases and route them to fast-agent while maintaining fallback capabilities.","Created fast-agent request interceptor that intelligently routes requests to fast-agent before falling back to original system. Includes streaming response simulation and proper error handling with fallback mechanisms.","Integrated fast-agent interceptor into existing chat API route. The interceptor now acts as the first-choice handler, checking for advanced use cases and routing to fast-agent before falling back to the original system. Supports both streaming and non-streaming responses.","Added fast-agent configuration to .env file with all necessary environment variables and created comprehensive documentation explaining the integration, configuration, usage, and troubleshooting.","Created comprehensive test script to verify fast-agent integration and fallback functionality. The script tests routing logic, fallback behavior, and API health. Added test command to package.json for easy execution."],"modified_files":["lib/api/fast-agent-service.ts","lib/api/fast-agent-interceptor.ts","app/api/chat/route.ts",".env","FAST_AGENT_INTEGRATION.md","test-fast-agent-integration.js","package.json"],"id":"1762810214035"}
